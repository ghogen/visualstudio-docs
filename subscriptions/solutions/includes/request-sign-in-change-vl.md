## How to change your sign-in email address for Visual Studio subscriptions
If your work or school purchases subscriptions through Volume Licensing or the Visual Studio Marketplace, they are managed by administrators.  Your administrator can change the email address you use to sign into your subscription.  

**Contact your administrator to request a change**
If you’re not sure who your administrators are, you may want to contact a colleague that has a subscription assigned to them.  They can contact the administrators by using the “Contact my Admin” feature in the Visual Studio subscriptions portal at https://my.visualstudio.com/subscriptions.  

**Use the Contact my Admin feature**
Please view our [Contact my Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/subscriptions/contact-my-admin.md) article for more information about the feature.
